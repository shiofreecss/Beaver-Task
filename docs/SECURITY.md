## Critical Security Issue: Credential Exposure in URLs

### Issue Description
The application was vulnerable to credential exposure through URL parameters. This is a critical security vulnerability that can lead to:

1. **Password exposure in browser history**
2. **Password exposure in server logs**
3. **Password exposure in browser cache**
4. **Password exposure in referrer headers**
5. **Password exposure in proxy logs**

### Example of the Vulnerability
```
http://localhost:3000/login?email=user@example.com&password=secret123
```

### Implemented Security Protections

#### 1. Client-Side Protection (LoginForm Component)
- **Detection**: Monitors URL parameters for `email` and `password`
- **Immediate Response**: Clears URL parameters using `window.history.replaceState()`
- **User Warning**: Displays security warning banner and toast notification
- **Logging**: Sends security event to `/api/security/log`

#### 2. Server-Side Protection (Middleware)
- **Detection**: Checks all incoming requests for credential parameters
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Redirects to clean URL without credentials
- **Security Logging**: Logs detailed security events with metadata
- **Prevention**: Blocks credential exposure before it reaches the application

#### 3. Security Headers (next.config.js)
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS and other injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection

#### 4. Security Monitoring (API Route)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/security/log`
- **Purpose**: Centralized security event logging
- **Data Captured**: Event type, details, user agent, IP, timestamp
- **Integration**: Ready for external security monitoring services

### Security Best Practices Implemented

#### 1. Never Store Credentials in URLs
- ✅ Form submissions use POST requests
- ✅ No credential pre-filling from URL parameters
- ✅ Immediate URL cleanup when credentials detected

#### 2. Secure Authentication Flow
- ✅ NextAuth.js for secure session management
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT tokens for session management
- ✅ Secure cookie handling

#### 3. Input Validation
- ✅ Zod schema validation for all forms
- ✅ Server-side validation for all inputs
- ✅ XSS protection through Content Security Policy

#### 4. Error Handling
- ✅ Generic error messages (no information leakage)
- ✅ Secure error logging
- ✅ No sensitive data in error responses

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Security Events Logged
1. **CREDENTIALS_IN_URL**: When credentials are detected in URL parameters
2. **LOGIN_ATTEMPT**: Failed login attempts
3. **SECURITY_VIOLATION**: Other security-related events

#### Log Data Captured
- Event type and details
- User agent string
- IP address (when available)
- Timestamp
- Request path and method
- Referrer information

### Recommendations for Production

#### 1. External Security Monitoring
- Integrate with services like Sentry, LogRocket, or DataDog
- Set up alerts for security events
- Monitor for patterns of credential exposure attempts

#### 2. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on login endpoints
- Block IPs with suspicious activity patterns
- Use CAPTCHA for repeated failed attempts

#### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Enable HTTPS only in production
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Add two-factor authentication
- Regular security audits

#### 4. User Education
- Display security tips on login page
- Provide clear guidance on secure password practices
- Warn against sharing login URLs

### Testing the Security Measures

#### Test Cases
1. **URL with credentials**: `http://localhost:3000/login?email=test@example.com&password=test123`
   - Expected: URL cleared, warning displayed, event logged

2. **Form submission**: Normal login form submission
   - Expected: No credentials in URL, secure POST request

3. **Direct API access**: Attempting to access login with credentials in URL
   - Expected: Redirected to clean URL, security event logged

### Emergency Response

If credential exposure is detected:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Clear any exposed URLs from logs
   - Reset affected user passwords
   - Review access logs for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check security logs for patterns
   - Identify source of credential exposure
   - Review application code for vulnerabilities

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify affected users
   - Update security documentation
   - Consider security advisory if necessary
