# Bluetooth Integration for Local Project Management

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for implementing Bluetooth-based local project management in the Beaver Task application. This feature would enable users to collaborate and manage projects in offline environments using Bluetooth connectivity.

## Use Cases
- Local team collaboration without internet dependency
- Peer-to-peer project sharing in offline environments
- Real-time updates between nearby team members
- Secure data transfer in sensitive environments where cloud sync isn't allowed

## Technical Components

### Required Components
1. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**
   - Device discovery
   - Connection management
   - Data transfer protocols

2. **Local Database Sync**
   - Data synchronization mechanism
   - Conflict resolution system
   - Transaction management

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - Device pairing
   - Data encryption
   - Access control

## Architecture Changes

### Database Schema Updates Needed
1. **Device Management**
   - Device identification
   - Pairing information
   - Trust relationships

2. **Sync Management**
   - Sync status tracking
   - Conflict resolution metadata
   - Last sync timestamps

### Implementation Layers

#### Backend Changes
1. **Bluetooth Service Layer**
   - Device discovery
   - Connection management
   - Data transfer protocols
   - Error handling

2. **Sync Engine**
   - Data synchronization
   - Conflict detection
   - Resolution strategies
   - Transaction management

#### Frontend Changes
1. **User Interface**
   - Device discovery view
   - Pairing interface
   - Sync status indicators
   - Conflict resolution UI
   - Connection management controls

## Technical Considerations

### Limitations
1. **Bluetooth Constraints**
   - Limited range (~10 meters)
   - Lower data transfer speeds compared to WiFi
   - Device compatibility issues
   - Battery consumption impact

2. **Data Management**
   - Handling large datasets
   - Dealing with connection interruptions
   - Managing concurrent updates
   - Data integrity verification

### Technology Stack
1. **Core Technologies**

   - Node.js Bluetooth libraries (desktop)
   - SQLite (local storage)
   - Custom sync protocol

2. **Security Components**
   - Bluetooth pairing authentication
   - Data encryption
   - Access control
   - Audit logging

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
1. **Transfer Security**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Secure pairing process
   - Man-in-the-middle protection

2. **Access Control**
   - Device authorization
   - User authentication
   - Permission management

### Audit & Compliance
1. **Logging**
   - Sync activities
   - Connection attempts
   - Security events
   - Error tracking
