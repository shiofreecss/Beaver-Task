# Logout Cleanup Fix

## Problem
When users logged out, two main issues occurred:
1. **Music continued playing** - Background music from the Pomodoro timer would continue playing even after logout
2. **Error logging but successful logout** - The logout process would show error messages in the console but still successfully log out the user

## Solution

### 1. Created Cleanup Service (`src/lib/cleanup-service.ts`)
A centralized service that handles all cleanup operations during logout:

- **Audio Cleanup**: Stops all background music and audio playback
- **Timer Cleanup**: Resets all active timers (Pomodoro, etc.)
- **Store Cleanup**: Resets all Zustand stores to initial state
- **Storage Cleanup**: Clears localStorage and sessionStorage
- **Page Unload Cleanup**: Handles cleanup when user closes browser or refreshes

### 2. Updated Logout Function (`src/components/sidebar.tsx`)
Modified the `handleLogout` function to:

- Call cleanup service before signOut
- Remove error toast messages that were confusing users
- Ensure navigation to login page even if cleanup fails
- Add fallback navigation using `window.location.href`

### 3. Added Reset Functions to All Stores
Added `resetStore()` functions to all Zustand stores:

- `src/store/pomodoro.ts` - Reset sessions and active timer
- `src/store/tasks.ts` - Reset tasks and columns
- `src/store/projects.ts` - Reset projects and cache
- `src/store/habits.ts` - Reset habits and loading state
- `src/store/notes.ts` - Reset notes
- `src/store/organizations.ts` - Reset organizations and cache

### 4. Added Cleanup Provider (`src/components/cleanup-provider.tsx`)
A React provider that sets up page unload event listeners to ensure cleanup happens when users close the browser or refresh the page.

### 5. Updated Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
Integrated the CleanupProvider into the main layout to ensure cleanup is available throughout the app.

## Key Features

### üéµ Music Stopping
- Automatically stops all background music when logging out
- Handles page unload events to stop music on browser close/refresh
- Uses the existing `audioService.stop()` method

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timer Management
- Resets all active Pomodoro timers
- Clears timer state from stores
- Prevents timers from continuing in background

### üóÇÔ∏è Store Cleanup
- Resets all application state to initial values
- Prevents data leakage between user sessions
- Ensures clean slate for next login

### üíæ Storage Cleanup
- Clears all localStorage and sessionStorage
- Removes specific app keys (pomodoro settings, etc.)
- Prevents settings from persisting between users

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling
- Graceful error handling during cleanup
- Logout continues even if cleanup fails
- Multiple fallback navigation methods

## Testing

A test script was created (`scripts/test-cleanup.js`) to verify the cleanup process works correctly.

## Usage

The cleanup is automatically triggered when:
1. User clicks the "Sign Out" button
2. User closes the browser tab/window
3. User refreshes the page

No additional user action is required - the cleanup happens seamlessly in the background.

## Technical Details

### Cleanup Service Methods
- `performLogoutCleanup()`: Main cleanup method called during logout
- `setupPageUnloadCleanup()`: Sets up event listeners for page unload
- `stopAllAudio()`: Stops all audio playback
- `stopAllTimers()`: Resets all active timers
- `clearAllStores()`: Resets all Zustand stores
- `clearAllStorage()`: Clears browser storage

### Store Reset Functions
Each store now has a `resetStore()` method that:
- Resets the store to its initial state
- Clears all data arrays
- Resets loading and error states
- Clears cache timestamps

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Music stops immediately on logout
2. **Clean State**: No data leakage between user sessions
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of audio and timer resources
4. **Error Reduction**: Eliminates confusing error messages during logout
5. **Security**: Ensures complete session cleanup

## Future Enhancements

- Add cleanup for WebSocket connections
- Implement cleanup for service workers
- Add cleanup for any future audio/timer features
